## Project Name:-Helmet detection AI project using YOLOv8l

## Description :- This project aims to detect helmets in images using deep learning techniques. It utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture trained on a dataset of images containing individuals wearing helmets. The model can be deployed for real-time helmet detection in various applications such as safety monitoring in construction sites, motorcycle riders, and sports activities.
